## ‚úçÔ∏è A Neural Network That Learns to Read Your Handwriting!

This repository hosts a beginner-friendly deep learning project built in Google Colab that trains a simple **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to accurately recognize handwritten digits (0-9). Utilizing the famous **MNIST dataset** and powered by **TensorFlow/Keras**, this project serves as an ideal "Hello World" for anyone diving into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **MNIST Dataset Integration:** Seamless loading and preprocessing of the industry-standard handwritten digits dataset.
* **Simple Neural Network Architecture:** A straightforward `Sequential` model with `Dense` layers, perfect for understanding core ANN concepts.
* **Training & Evaluation:** Robust training process with 'Adam' optimizer and 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' loss, followed by comprehensive evaluation on unseen test data.
* **Visual Predictions:** Ability to visualize actual test images alongside the model's predictions, highlighting correct and incorrect classifications.
* **Google Colab Ready:** Designed to run entirely within Google Colab, leveraging free GPU/TPU access for faster training without any local setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **TensorFlow / Keras:** For building and training the neural network.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations and data handling.
* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization and plotting results.
* **Google Colab:** The cloud-based environment for development and execution.

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

1.  **Open in Google Colab:** Click on the `MNIST_Digit_Recognizer.ipynb` notebook file in this repository. It will open directly in Google Colab.
    * *Self-correction: The notebook name is `MNIST_Digit_Recognizer.ipynb` based on our previous discussion.*
2.  **Run All Cells:** Once opened, go to `Runtime` -> `Run all` in the Colab menu. The notebook will download the dataset, preprocess it, build and train the model, and then evaluate it.
3.  **Explore Outputs:** Observe the training progress, accuracy metrics, and the visual predictions of handwritten digits.
